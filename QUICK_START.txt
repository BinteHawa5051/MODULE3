QUICK START GUIDE - Adaptive Reasoning Agent
============================================

🚀 APP IS RUNNING AT: http://localhost:8501

STEP 1: SETUP (Already Done!)
==============================
✅ HuggingFace API Key: Pre-configured
✅ Model: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
✅ Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

STEP 2: TEST EACH TOOL
=======================

📅 DATETIME TOOL (Always Works)
--------------------------------
Try these:
→ "What time is it?"
→ "What day is today?"
→ "Tell me the current date"

Result: Instant response with current date/time


🔍 WEB SEARCH TOOL (Needs Serper API Key)
------------------------------------------
1. Add Serper API key in sidebar (optional)
2. Try these:
   → "Search for latest Python news"
   → "Find information about AI"
   → "Look up machine learning"

Result: Shows search results in reasoning panel
- Slow network = 3 results (shallow)
- Fast network = 10 results (deep)


📄 DOCUMENT CREATION TOOLS (Always Works)
------------------------------------------
Try these:
→ "Create a PDF about machine learning"
→ "Generate a Word document on Python"
→ "Make a summary and give me as PDF"

Result: Download button appears below response
- PDF: Uses reportlab
- Word: Uses python-docx
- Excel: Uses openpyxl


📚 RAG TOOL (Upload Documents First)
-------------------------------------
1. Click "Upload documents for RAG" in sidebar
2. Upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
3. Click "Process Documents"
4. Try these:
   → "What does my document say about [topic]?"
   → "Summarize the uploaded document"
   → "Find information about [keyword] in my files"

Result: Agent uses document context in answers


🎯 COMBINED TOOLS
-----------------
Try these to use multiple tools:
→ "What's the date and search for today's news"
→ "Search for Python tutorials and create a PDF"
→ "Tell me the time and summarize my document"


STEP 3: TEST NETWORK ADAPTATION
================================

1. Go to sidebar → Network Settings
2. Try different modes:
   - Slow: Fast reasoning (1 step)
   - Medium: Standard reasoning (2 steps)
   - Fast: Deep reasoning (3 steps)
   - Auto: Detects automatically

3. Ask same question in different modes
4. Click "🧠 Reasoning Process" to see differences


STEP 4: VIEW TOOL USAGE
========================

After each query:
1. Expand "🧠 Reasoning Process"
2. See:
   - Mode used (fast/standard/deep)
   - Network speed detected
   - Tools detected
   - Tools actually used
   - Execution time
   - RAG chunks used


EXAMPLE SESSION
===============

Query 1: "What time is it?"
→ Tool: datetime
→ Mode: Adapts to network
→ Result: Current time shown

Query 2: "Search for AI news"
→ Tool: web_search
→ Mode: Adapts to network
→ Result: Search results + answer

Query 3: "Create a PDF summary"
→ Tool: create_pdf
→ Mode: Adapts to network
→ Result: PDF download button

Query 4: Upload doc + "What does it say?"
→ Tool: RAG
→ Mode: Adapts to network
→ Result: Answer using document context


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

❌ "Serper API key not provided"
→ Web search needs API key (optional)
→ Other tools work without it

❌ "No documents uploaded"
→ RAG needs documents first
→ Upload in sidebar

✅ All other tools work immediately!
